## About...

My first experience with Linux was in 1997. I was 16 years old when I downloaded all 13 floppy disk images required to install Slackware. Most likely written to repurposed demo request floppy disks which I received dozens of in the mail everyday. 

Though I did have an interest in operating systems and learning to program the real motivating factor was to run one of the cool sexy new futuristic looking interfaces like BlackBox or Enlightenment. What might have impressed me even more was this LiKnucks even came with an IRC client with a swear word name. Everything about it felt cool and artistic in a way. 

As I started learning the UNIX philosophy I started to appreciate the design of the system itself allows for a type of artistic expression. Typing a clever set of powerful commands piped in the right way to make something new is artistic in the same way as putting together the right chords to make a song. 

Learning to think of computing as an artistic endeavor led me to a 15+ year career in engineering. It gives me the confidence to tackle any complex system or problem. This includes designing solutions that leverage open source tools, building reliable / sclable infrastructure, and automating & optimizing operations. The combination of creativity, or at least cleverness, and mastery of powerful tools is the solution to every problem.
